## Task 1: Sales Data Analysis

### Overview
This task focused on analyzing a commercial store's sales data to identify daily, weekly, and monthly trends. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, the goal was to provide actionable insights for improving sales performance.

### Steps Completed
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
   - Imported raw sales data.
   - Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Examined sales distributions across time intervals.
   - Identified peak and off-peak periods.

3. **Visualization**
   - Developed bar charts and line graphs using `Matplotlib` to visualize sales trends.

4. **Reporting**
   - Created a comprehensive report summarizing sales trends and actionable insights.

### Key Findings
- **Daily Trends:** Weekends showed significantly higher sales compared to weekdays.
- **Monthly Trends:** End-of-month periods saw a spike in sales, potentially due to promotional offers.
- **Off-Peak Periods:** Identified opportunities to improve sales during weekdays.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of sales trends.
- **Excel**: Preliminary data review.

## Task 2: Social Media Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This task involved analyzing over 52,000 tweets to uncover public sentiment trends. By employing advanced NLP and ML techniques, the objective was to classify sentiments and extract actionable insights.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned text by removing URLs, hashtags, mentions, and emojis.
   - Applied tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

2. **Sentiment Classification**
   - Used multiple models:
     - **VADER**: Polarity scoring for short texts.
     - **TextBlob**: Sentiment polarity and subjectivity scoring.
     - **BERT**: Context-sensitive sentiment classification.

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Implemented AdaBoost Classifier with TF-IDF vectorization.
   - Achieved 83.9% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Topic Modeling**
   - Used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify key themes.

### Key Insights
- **Sentiment Trends:** Neutral tweets dominated, followed by positive and negative sentiments.
- **Engagement Metrics:** Positive tweets received higher likes and shares.
- **Themes Identified:** Gratitude, social activities, and complaints were the primary topics.

### Future Recommendations
- **Model Improvement:** Fine-tune BERT for better performance on imbalanced datasets.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Implement systems for monitoring tweets in real-time.
- **Multilingual Analysis:** Expand sentiment analysis to non-English tweets.
