## Task 1: Sales Data Analysis

### Overview
The objective of this task was to analyze a commercial store's sales data to uncover daily, weekly, and monthly trends. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, actionable insights were generated to optimize sales strategies.

### Approach and Process
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Handled missing values, corrected data formats, and removed duplicates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed descriptive statistics and visualized sales distributions.

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Identified peak sales periods, off-peak days, and promotional impacts.

4. **Visualization**
   - Created time-series plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to represent sales trends visually.

5. **Reporting and Insights**
   - Summarized key findings in a structured report with actionable recommendations.

### Key Insights
- **Daily Trends:** Sales peaked on weekends, indicating strong weekend shopper behavior.
- **Monthly Trends:** Month-end periods consistently showed increased sales, likely driven by promotional campaigns.
- **Off-Peak Patterns:** Opportunities to boost weekday sales were identified through targeted offers.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Streamlined data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Enabled dynamic and static visualizations.
- **Excel**: Assisted with initial data review.

## Task 2: Social Media Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This project focused on analyzing over 52,000 tweets to classify public sentiment and extract actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed noise such as URLs, mentions, and emojis.
   - Applied tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword filtering.

2. **Sentiment Classification**
   - **VADER:** Scored short-text sentiments.
   - **TextBlob:** Assessed polarity and subjectivity.
   - **BERT:** Employed for context-aware sentiment analysis.

3. **Machine Learning Implementation**
   - Trained AdaBoost Classifier using TF-IDF vectorized features.
   - Achieved an accuracy of 83.9% post-hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Topic Modeling**
   - Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover key themes from the tweets.

### Insights and Results
- **Dominant Sentiments:** Neutral sentiments formed the majority, followed by positive and negative sentiments.
- **Engagement Patterns:** Positive sentiments had significantly higher likes and shares.
- **Identified Themes:** Key topics included customer feedback, gratitude, and product-related complaints.

### Future Directions
- **Enhanced Modeling:** Fine-tune BERT for better classification on imbalanced datasets.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Build pipelines for live sentiment tracking.
- **Multilingual Support:** Expand sentiment analysis to non-English texts.
